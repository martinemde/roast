Review the code for adherence to software engineering best practices.

Evaluate:

1. **Code Organization**
   - Single Responsibility Principle adherence
   - Appropriate abstraction levels
   - Module/class cohesion
   - Proper separation of concerns

2. **Code Readability**
   - Clear and descriptive naming
   - Appropriate comment usage
   - Consistent formatting
   - Complex logic explanation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error catching
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Proper error propagation
   - Recovery strategies

4. **Testing Considerations**
   - Testability of the code
   - Dependency injection usage
   - Mock-friendly interfaces
   - Clear test boundaries

5. **Maintainability**
   - DRY principle adherence
   - Configuration externalization
   - Magic number/string avoidance
   - Future extensibility

For each area:
- Note adherence to best practices
- Identify violations or concerns
- Suggest specific improvements
- Provide refactoring examples where helpful

Balance pragmatism with idealism - focus on changes that provide real value.
