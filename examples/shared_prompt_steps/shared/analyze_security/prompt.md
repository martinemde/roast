Analyze the provided code for potential security vulnerabilities and risks.

Focus on identifying:

1. **Input Validation Issues**
   - Unvalidated user inputs
   - Missing sanitization
   - Improper type checking

2. **Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - SQL injection risks
   - Command injection possibilities
   - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities
   - LDAP/XML injection risks

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Weak authentication mechanisms
   - Missing authorization checks
   - Session management issues
   - Insecure password handling

4. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Unencrypted data transmission
   - Insecure data storage
   - Information leakage in logs/errors

5. **Common Security Misconfigurations**
   - Insecure defaults
   - Overly permissive settings
   - Missing security headers
   - Debug mode in production

For each vulnerability found:
- Explain the specific risk
- Provide the exact location in the code
- Suggest a concrete fix with example code
- Rate the severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

If the code appears secure, highlight the good security practices observed.
