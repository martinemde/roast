[0.4.1]: https://github.com/Shopify/roast/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-12

### Added
- **Input step type** for collecting user input during workflow execution (#154)
  - Interactive prompts pause workflow execution to collect user input
  - Supports multiple input types: `text` (default), `confirm`, `select`, and `password`
  - `confirm` type provides yes/no prompts with boolean results
  - `select` type allows choosing from a list of options
  - `password` type masks input for sensitive data using io/console
  - Input values are stored in workflow output and accessible via dot notation (e.g., `{{output.step_name}}`)
  - Integrates with CLI::UI for consistent formatting and user experience
- **Agent step type** for direct pass-through to coding agents (#151)
  - Steps prefixed with `^` send prompts directly to the CodingAgent tool
  - Supports both file-based and inline agent prompts
  - Bypasses LLM interpretation for precise agent instructions

### Fixed
- DotAccessHash array wrapping and template response handling
- CLI::UI formatting and color handling for better terminal output

## [0.3.1] - 2025-06-05

### Added
- Default `print_response: true` for the last step in a workflow (#100)
  - The last step now automatically prints its response unless explicitly configured otherwise
  - Helps newcomers who would otherwise see no output from their workflows
  - Works with all step types: string steps, hash steps with variable assignment, and conditional steps
  - Parallel steps and iteration steps are intelligently handled (no automatic output since there's no single "last" step)

### Fixed
- PromptStep now properly passes `print_response`, `json`, and `params` parameters to chat_completion

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-04

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Upgraded to Raix 1.0.0 (#141)
  - Removed the deprecated `loop` parameter from chat_completion calls
  - Raix 1.0 automatically continues after tool calls until providing a text response
  - All chat completions now return strings (no longer arrays or complex structures)
  - JSON responses are automatically parsed when `json: true` is specified
- **BREAKING**: Removed configurable `loop` and `auto_loop` options from workflow configuration (#140)
  - The `loop:` and `auto_loop:` YAML configuration options have been removed entirely
  - Looping behavior is now automatic: always enabled when tools are present, disabled when no tools exist
  - This simplifies the codebase and makes behavior more predictable
  - To migrate: remove any `loop: true/false` or `auto_loop: true/false` settings from your workflow YAML files

### Fixed
- Enhanced boolean coercion to treat empty strings as false
- Improved iterable coercion to handle JSON array strings
- Fixed all tests to work with Raix 1.0's string-only responses

## [0.2.3] - 2025-05-29

### Fixed
- Model inheritance for nested steps in iteration steps (#105)
  - Nested steps within `repeat` and `each` blocks now properly inherit model configuration
  - Configuration hierarchy works correctly: step-specific → workflow-level → default model
  - Previously, nested steps always used the default model regardless of configuration

## [0.2.2] - 2025-05-29

### Added
- Pre/post processing framework for workflows with `pre_processing` and `post_processing` sections (#86)
  - Support for `output.txt` ERB templates in post-processing phase for custom output formatting
  - Pre/post processing support for single-target workflows (not just multi-target)
  - Simplified access to pre-processing data in target workflows (removed `output` intermediary level)
- Verbose mode improvements for better debugging experience (#98)
  - Command outputs are now displayed when using the `--verbose` flag
  - Commands executed within conditional branches also show output in verbose mode
- User-friendly error reporting for workflow failures (#98)
  - Clear ❌ indicators when commands or steps fail
  - Command failures show exit status and output (no verbose needed for failures)
  - Step failures provide helpful context about what might be wrong
  - Exit handler displays actionable suggestions for resolving issues
- Automatic workflow discovery by name (#97)
  - Can now run workflows by name without full path: `roast execute my_workflow`
  - Automatically looks for `roast/my_workflow/workflow.yml` in current directory
- Configurable base URI for API endpoints (#83)

### Fixed
- Search file tool now correctly prefixes paths when searching (#92)
- Support for Ruby projects using ActiveSupport 7.0+ (#95)

### Changed
- ActiveSupport dependency relaxed to >= 7.0 for broader compatibility

## [0.2.1]

### Added
- Smart coercion defaults for boolean expressions based on step type
  - Ruby expressions (`{{expr}}`) default to regular boolean coercion
  - Bash commands (`$(cmd)`) default to exit code interpretation
  - Inline prompts and regular steps default to "smart" LLM-powered interpretation (looks for truthy or falsy language)
- Direct syntax for step configuration - `coerce_to` and other options are now specified directly on iteration steps

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-26

### Added
- Conditional execution support with `if` and `unless` clauses for workflow steps
- Iteration mechanisms for workflows with `repeat` and `each` constructs (resolving issue #48)
- Support for conditional repetition with `until` condition and safety limits
- Collection iteration with variable binding for processing lists of items
- State persistence for loop iterations to enable resumption after failure
- Standardized evaluation of Ruby expressions in iteration constructs using `{{}}` syntax
- Support for using bash commands, step names, and Ruby expressions in iteration conditions and collections
- Intelligent LLM response to boolean conversion with pattern-based recognition for natural language responses
- `exit_on_error` configuration option for command steps to continue workflow on failure (resolving issue #71)
- Dot notation access for workflow outputs (e.g., `workflow.output.step.field`)
- `--pause` flag for stepping through workflow execution interactively

### Fixed
- Automatically add `.gitignore` file to cache directory when created (completing issue #22)
- Load initializers before trying to load tools in case custom tools are defined in initializers (thanks @palkan)
- Fix loading of targetless workflows (thanks @palkan)
- Fix OpenRouter support (thanks @xrendan)
- API authentication error handling and model access issues
- Conditional step transcript replay regression
- DotAccessHash serialization for AI prompts

### Improved

- Major refactoring to eliminate circular dependencies and improve architecture
- Extracted command execution logic into dedicated CommandExecutor class
- Separated conditional execution from iteration logic for better SOLID compliance
- Enhanced error messages for API authentication failures
- Replaced all `require_relative` with `require` statements for consistency
